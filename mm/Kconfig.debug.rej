+	  Fill the pages with poison patterns after free_pages() and verify
+	  the patterns before alloc_pages. The filling of the memory helps

+	   Skip the sanity checking on alloc, only fill the pages with
+	   poison on free. This reduces some of the overhead of the

+	   Instead of using the existing poison value, fill the pages with
+	   zeros. This makes it harder to detect when errors are occurring
+	   due to sanitization but the zeroing at free means that it is
+	   no longer necessary to write zeros when GFP_ZERO is used on
