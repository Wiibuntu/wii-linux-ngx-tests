-         The scrollback buffer of the standard VGA console is located in
-	 the VGA RAM.  The size of this RAM is fixed and is quite small.
-	 If you require a larger scrollback buffer, this can be placed in
-	 System RAM which is dynamically allocated during initialization.
-	 Placing the scrollback buffer in System RAM will slightly slow
-	 down the console.

-	 If you want this feature, say 'Y' here and enter the amount of
-	 RAM to allocate for this buffer.  If unsure, say 'N'.
